\item{a.} false

Let $A_n = (0, {1\over n})$.
We can show that $\bigcap_{n=1}^n A_n = \emptyset$;
Let $x$ be a positive real number.
We want to show that $x$ is not in the intersection.
Since $1 / \ceil{1\over x} \le x$,
$A_{\ceil{1\over x}}$ does not contain $x$,
so $x$ cannot be in the intersection.
There are no nonpositive numbers in any $A_n$,
so they cannot be in the intersection, either.

\item{b.} true

Lemma. There is a natural number $k$ such that
$A_n = A_k$ for all $n$ such that $n \ge k$.

Proof. Since $A_1$ is finite,
there are finitely many natural numbers between $|A_1|$ and $0$.
Since $A_n \subseteq A_{n-1}$ for each natural number $n \ge 2$,
$|A_n| \le |A_{n-1}|$.
Therefore, there are finitely many natural numbers $n$ such that
$|A_n| < |A_{n-1}|$.
Let $k$ be the largest such $n$.
We can now conclude that for each $n$ such that $n \ge k$,
$|A_n| = |A_k|$, and since $A_n \subseteq A_k$,
we have $A_n = A_k$, as desired.

The intersection is therefore equal to
$\bigcap_{n=1}^k A_n = A_k$,
which is finite and nonempty, as desired.

\item{c.} false

Let $A = B = \{1\}$ and $C = \{2\}$.
Then $A \cap (B \cup C) = \{1\}$,
which is not equal to
$(A \cap B) \cup C = \{1,2\}$.
